# Roots with Bedrock Wordpress Docker container for local development
Custom wordpress docker container for local development with Roots, Bedrock and Laravel integration.

I looked endlessly for a good docker blueprint but didn't find any, so this was my attempt to make my own. It's not very widely tested, but I know it works perfectly as of late 2024.
